##Linking into the a site
During development, link the folder into the app using New-Junction -LiteralPath "C:\Projects\NÃ¤ktergal\Trunk\Naktergal\nCustomerPages\a" -TargetPath "C:\Projects\Git\balanzia-se-companyloan-application\dist\balanzia-se-companyloan-application"
and then run 
>> ng build --watch --base-href='/a/'
 to enable live development. (F5 after edit required) Note that the trailing / is important or resources wont resolve properly.

In production copy the content of dist/balanzia-se-companyloan-application into the /a folder of some site in either the build process or deploy process.

You can also test the application by itself using
>> ng serve

##Testing on local wifi

>> ipconfig
Look for 'Something Wifi' and 'IPv4 Address'. It should be something like 192.168.x.xxx or similar unroutable address.

>> ng serve --host [your ip]
